🔥 Python Projects Collection – Prodigy Internship

This repository contains five Python projects developed as part of my Software Development internship at Prodigy Infotech. These projects demonstrate practical implementation of core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, file handling, web scraping, and algorithmic logic.

1️⃣ Temperature Converter 🌡

A simple CLI-based utility to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

Features:

Accepts user input for temperature value and unit (C, F, or K)
Converts the input to the other two units
Rounded output with units displayed clearly
Sample Input/Output: Input: 25 C Output: The temperature in Fahrenheit is: 77.0°F The temperature in Kelvin is: 298.1K

2️⃣ Number Guessing Game 🎯

A classic terminal-based game where the player guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

Features:

Random number generator
Feedback for each guess: Too high / Too low / Correct
Keeps count of the number of attempts
3️⃣ Contact Management System 📇

A command-line application to manage a simple contact book.

Features:

Add, view, update, search, and delete contacts
Contacts are stored as dictionaries in memory
Clean and user-friendly menu-driven interface
4️⃣ Sudoku Solver 🧩

A backtracking algorithm that solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.

Features:

Accepts a partially filled Sudoku grid
Uses recursive backtracking to solve the puzzle
Outputs the solved board neatly
Note: Empty cells in the input grid must be represented as 0.

5️⃣ Web Scraping Project 🛒

Scrapes product information from a sample e-commerce website (books.toscrape.com) and saves it to a CSV file.

Features:

Extracts: Book Title, Price (converted to INR), Rating
Uses requests and BeautifulSoup for scraping
Saves data into a structured books.csv file using pandas
🔧 Requirements

Install required libraries: pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

📂 Output Files

books.csv – Product data from the web scraper
Contacts are managed in-memory (persistence optional)
